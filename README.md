## Introduction
A web application that enables freehand sketching and attempts to transfer it to a "rendered" mode using a Generative Adversarial Network, while converting any preferred option to a 3d model representation.
This is the front-end application for the SketchTo3D pitch for [**AEC Tech 2019: Hackathon**](http://core.thorntontomasetti.com/aec-tech-2019-nyc/aec-tech-2019-hackathon/). It was developed by team **doodleGANg**.

## Getting Started

Just fire-Up a web browser and go to this [address](http://184.105.174.119:3001/). Then you can just start sketching and the GAN will sort out the visual representation of your doodle. When happy with the results you can push the data to the backend application which will provide an approximated **Rhino** 3d model rendered on the UI.

## Purpose

To re-establish freehand sketching as a design tool, enhancing it with automated 3dimensional content using the power of Generative Adversarial networks.
